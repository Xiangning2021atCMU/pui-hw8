The website has many interactions with the users. Several JS libraries are adapted to add animation effects, all the icons and buttons are functional, the users can directly be led to the files/website/sessions when they click on them.

iv. Who is the target audience?

Recruiters from tech companies.

## d. Using your website:

Use a bulleted list to describe how a user would interact

with your website. For each item in your list, say

i. the interaction type you implemented

ii. how I should reproduce it (i.e. click on X on page Y, or scroll on page X,

etc.)

- scroll down: when a user scrolls down, the navigation bar’s background turns to pink to give users nav options.

- button/icon: all the icons or buttons have the transition that when you hover on them, the color will get darker.

- button/icon: All the icons and buttons are functional:

- For "Explore more" is a clickable phrase and when you hover on it, it will move downwards, click it, it will move the page to About session.

- if you click on the social media icons, it will lead you to my social media account.

- for the Download CV button, you click it then you can get my CV downloaded to your local Downloads file.

- for the "Go to project GitHub(icon)" button, you click it, then you will be led to the GitHub page for that project with code and project details shown in readme.

- for the "Send" button in the contact me session, you click it, then you will be led to a page to validate that you are a human and tell you that the message has been sent to my email, which is actually sent to my real email!

- input: in the contact session, the users can input their name, email and message to send me messages.

- list: in the skills session, the first list is by default open, you can click the arrow to fold it and unfold it. The arrow's direction changes according to whether its list is folded or not.

## e. External libraries:

1. Typed.js library.

- why use it: it has super clean documents to follow and it implements the functionality, also it’s novel to have several words typed interchangeably.

- how to use it, I added the official script in my html file and js code as well.

- what it adds: In the home session, it adds the typing animation, which is typing in loop with several words about me being typed interchangeably.

2. Swiper.js library.

- why use it: it has super clean documents to follow and it’s easy to implement the functionality, also it’s a common functionality to show several projects using a slider.

- how to use it, I added the official script in my html file and js code as well.

- what it adds: In the project session, it adds the sliding effect of three projects, you can click on the left and right arrow to check the effect.

## f. Iteration from HW7:

I have added more animations utilizing the js libraries I mentioned above, and adjusted the layout to achieve responsiveness.

## g. Major challenges:

The css styles are big challenges for me to implement to achieve responsiveness.
