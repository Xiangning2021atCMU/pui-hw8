## e. External libraries:

- Typed.js library.

  - how to use it, I added the official script in my html file and js code as well.

  - what it adds: In the home session, it adds the typing animation, which is typing in loop with several words about me being typed interchangeably.

- Swiper.js library.

  - why use it: it has super clean documents to follow and it’s easy to implement the functionality, also it’s a common functionality to show several projects using a slider.

  - how to use it, I added the official script in my html file and js code as well.

  - what it adds: In the project session, it adds the sliding effect of three projects, you can click on the left and right arrow to check the effect.
